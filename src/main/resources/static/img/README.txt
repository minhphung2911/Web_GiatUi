Image Directory

This directory is intended for storing image files used in the web application.

To add images:
1. Use PNG, JPG, or SVG formats for best compatibility
2. Keep file sizes optimized for web use
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., user-avatar.png, service-laundry.jpg)
4. For user avatars, a recommended size is 200x200 pixels

Images placed here will be accessible at /img/filename.extension in your application.
